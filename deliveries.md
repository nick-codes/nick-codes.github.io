Deliveries are best made to our side door so as not to be in a high
traffic area of the apartment complex.

There are three entrance to the Oak Creek Apartment complex we live in
which can make things confusing. Our entrance is the “Oak Creek Apts”
entrance between Stock Farm Rd and Santa Cruz avenue. They say a
picture is worth a thousand words so I have provided one to save
myself some typing.

When you turn in drive straight ahead past the entrance to the parking
garage.  There is a path on the right to a flight of stairs to the
patio over the parking garage. On the patio turn left past the tree
and you will see a stairwell with a green door and a shopping cart.

Please deliver to the side of this door under the stairs, in the
shopping cart is great. Here is a photo of the stair well with
the shopping cart.
