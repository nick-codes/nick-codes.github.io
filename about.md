Nick's first words were 'More Cheese'.  When he isn't busy consuming a
creamy dill havarti, or a smoked gouda, you will find him writing
code.

Nick holds a PhD in Distributed Software for Mobile Devices form the
VU University Amsterdam, a masters in Parallel and Distributed
Computer Systems from the same school, and a Bachelor of Science in
Computer Engineering from the University of Arizona. He has been
involved with projects for distributed decision support, cloud and
mobile integration, context management and sensing using mobile
devices, data management and synchronization, computation and
communication offloading to cloud resources, as well as several
distributed multi-player games.

Nick also has extensive industry experience, having worked at several
small startups. He has worked at all levels of the stack from hacking
on the internals of an embedded Java virtual machine, and porting to
various real-time embedded operating systems, to middle-ware for the
cable billing industry, to front-end applications and servers for
traders in fixed income derivatives, not to mention various websites.

In addition to raw engineering talent, Nick also likes to think he has
an eye for design, a strong sense of industry trends, and natural
leadership skills. When he isn’t busy with coding for money he loves
to cook and to practice Ving Tsun Kung Fu, which we suggest you don’t
ask him about, unless you have some time to spare.
